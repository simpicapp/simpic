Simpic is a simple picture hosting service, effectively a slimmed down and self-hosted alternative to Google Photos.

* Quickly and easily upload files by dragging and dropping them to your browser
* View all files in an infinite-scrolling timeline view
* Click on images to pop them out in a lightbox
* Bulk select images with ctrl+click and shift+click shortcuts
* Organise images into albums for easy browsing

Simpic is still early in its life, and at this point is considered a "minimal viable product".
That means it works, but it does as little as possible while still being useful!
You can see planned features in the https://github.com/simpicapp/simpic/issues[issue tracker];
feel free to chime in if you have suggestions or spot bugs!

== Running

Simpic is intended to be ran using Docker. If you want to see it distributed in another way,
please https://github.com/simpicapp/simpic/issues/new[open an issue] and tell us about it.

Simpic requires a Postgres database to use to store meta-data, and a directory on disk where
it can write photos and thumbnails to. At present Simpic expects to be ran behind a reverse
proxy that can handle TLS termination for it.

You can get a copy of Simpic and a Postgres database for it to use by using the
example docker-compose.yml file in this repository. Assuming you have
https://docs.docker.com/install/[installed docker]
and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose], all you need to do is
grab the file, change the passwords to your liking, and then:

----
docker-compose up -d
----

Simpic will be accessible on port 8080.

== Developing

=== Project structure

Simpic has a Go backend and a TypeScript frontend that uses Vue.js. The Go code lives under `cmd` (for the program
entry points) and `internal` (for everything else). The TypeScript is contained under the `frontend` folder.

The frontend uses the https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api[Vue Composition API] in preparation for migration
to Vue3. New logic should, where possible, be written in pure TypeScript under `frontend/src/features` and then
pulled in from the `setup()` methods in the component.

=== Hot reloading

The NPM project in `frontend` has a `serve` script that will run a hot-module-reloading development server,
and it is configured to pass API calls to localhost on port 8080. To get it up and running:

    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run serve

== Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

There is a https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] to go fmt and run basic checks on
commit; to enable it simply:
