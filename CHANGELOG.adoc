= Changelog

== v2.0

=== Features

* Added ability to delete albums
* The toolbar when selecting images is now less intrusive and uses icons
* Simpic now creates a "screen friendly" version of photos for use in the UI (JPEG, maximum height 2160px)
* Photos are now rotated according to their EXIF orientation tags
* Added support for ORF, CV2, and many other formats!
* Added option to download image in various formats from the lightbox

==== Visibility

Albums and photos now have a visibility setting, which can be one of:

* *Public*:
** public photos always appear in the timeline and any albums they're added to;
** public albums are listed in the albums page for all users.
* *Unlisted*:
** unlisted photos only appear in the timeline or public albums for logged-in users;
** unlisted albums only appear in the albums page for logged-in users
** if an anonymous user knows the ID (or URL) for an unlisted resource they can still see it
** if an anonymous user browses an unlisted album they will see unlisted photos in it
* *Private*:
** photos and albums are hidden and cannot be seen or browsed except by logged-in users

Visibility for albums is selected when creating a new one.
Visibility for newly uploaded photos can be controlled with the `SIMPIC_DEFAULT_VISIBILITY` env var.

=== Fixes

* Fixed version not being set in docker builds
* Album covers are now updated if you remove that photo from the album
* Fixed the borders on some input fields being a bit off in Chrome
